Click on any two cards with your mouse pointer, and they will turn over. If they aren't a match, they will shake and turn red. If they are a match, they'll pulsate and turn green. Try and find all 8 matching pairs as quickly as you can! 

If you want to start again, you can at any point, by clicking the reset button on the top-right of the board.

## Star Rating
Each set of two cards that you click count as one move. The ratings are calculated as follows:

* **3 stars** - Find all 8 matches in just 10 moves or less (VERY difficult!)
* **2 stars** - Find all 8 matches in 20 moves or less
* **1 star** - Find all 8 matches in 30 moves or less

## Dependencies
There are no external dependencies needed to enjoy this game - all necessary JavaScript and CSS is included in the zipped folder you download.




I hope you enjoy the game and have fun!
